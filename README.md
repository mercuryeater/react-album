# react-album

This is the solution to "album en React" project of Make It Real.

## Overview

The user will see a card with the cover of an album, the name of the artist, the song with the date of release, genre and a like button that can be pressed to change it's appearance.

## My process

### Built with

- HTML5
- CSS
- Block Element Modifier (BEM) Notation
- Flexbox
- REACT
- Vite

### What I learned

I used an icon inside a button for the firs time and correctly set an _state var_ inside it, however I'm still figuring out how to change the style of the button accordingly.

### Continued development

A lot to try and re-do.
